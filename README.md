##Why i create this?
So basiclly I'm a pure angle, I've seen some poor server owners that want to test their server performance but don't know how to do that, so i created this software.

##How to use?
Open your terminal and type this
```
java -jar <path to file you have downloaded>
```
If that's still too vague for you, know what?, google is your friend "how to run a .jar file".
