# Simple Minecraft DDoS VERSION 2.0

## Introduction

In short: I just made this to test my server's load

In detail: the app will create tons of non-premium minecraft 1.21.1 clients to join the server and make the server's resources handle a lot of players at once, the server might get tired and take a break.

## Why did I create this?

So basically I'm a pure angle, I've seen some poor server owners that want to test their server's performance but don't know how to do that, so I created this software. Pull requests are welcome <3

## How to use?

Open your terminal and type this

```
java -jar <path to SimpleMinecraftDDoS.jar>
```

My English is not really good so if it's still too vague for you, know what? google is your friend's "how to run a .jar file".

## FAQs

**Question: Why the software is not working?**
Answer: The server might doesn't use via version and viabackward plugin (my software fake 1.18.2 client to join the server, will update more versions later), or it's a premium server.

**Question: How do we DDoS non-local servers?**
Answer: So basically you need to know their server's PORTs

**Question: Why only 1 bot is joined when DDoS-ing a non-local server?**
Answer: So because you're using the SAME IP to DDoS, it's easy for the router to apply mitigations to your data traffic. Most of DDoS software nowadays uses botnets, which DDoS by a lot of different computers, which means different IPs, so it's hard to deal with them more than DDoS from just 1 machine. SO YOU CAN STILL DDoS other servers but try to set the DELAY TIME PER BOT to higher, maybe 5000, but that's not gonna do much damage to their server btw.

**Question: How can you be so handsome?**
Answer: Coding
