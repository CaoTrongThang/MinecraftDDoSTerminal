# Simple Minecraft DDoS VERSION 2.0 (Windows Only)

## Introduction

In short: my only purpose was to make this to test my server's load, give me a start so I can update it <3

In detail: the app will create tons of non-premium minecraft 1.21.1 clients to join the server and make the server's resources handle a lot of players at once, the server might get tired and take a break.

## FAQs

**Question: Why the software is not working?**
Answer: The servers don't have via version and via backward plugin (my software fakes 1.18.2 client to join the server, will update more versions later), or it's a **premium** server.

**Question: How do we DDoS non-local servers?**
Answer: So basically you need to know their server's PORTs

**Question: Why only 1 bot is joined when DDoS-ing a non-local server?**
Answer: So because you're using the SAME IP to DDoS, it's easy for the router to apply mitigations to your data traffic. Most DDoS software nowadays uses botnets, which DDoS by a lot of different computers, which means different IPs, so it's hard to deal with them more than DDoS from just 1 machine. SO YOU CAN STILL DDoS other servers but try to set the DELAY TIME PER BOT to higher, maybe 5000, but that's not gonna do much damage to their server btw.

**Question: How can you be so handsome?**
Answer: Coding
