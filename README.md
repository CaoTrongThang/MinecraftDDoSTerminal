# Simple Minecraft DDoS

## Introduction

In short: DDoS a minecraft server that you want.

In detail: the software will create tons of non-premium minecraft 1.18.2 clients to join the server and makes the server's resources to handle alot of players at once, the server might get tired and take a break.

## Why i create this?

So basiclly I'm a pure angle, I've seen some poor server owners that want to test their server's performance but don't know how to do that, so i created this software. Pull requests are welcome <3

My English is not really good so if it's still too vague for you, know what?, google is your friend "how to run a .jar file".

## FAQs

**Question: Why the sofware is not working?**
Answer: The server might doesn't use viaversion and viabackward plugin (my sofware fake 1.18.2 client to join the server, will update more version later), or it's a premium server.

**Question: How to DDoS non-local server?**
Answer: So basiclly you need to know their server's PORTs

**Question: Why only 1 bot is joined when DDoS-ing non-local server?**
Answer: So because you're using the SAME IP to DDoS, it's easy for the router to apply mitigations to your data traffic. Most of DDoS softwares nowadays use botnet, which DDoS by alot of different computers, which mean different IP, so it's hard to deal with them more than DDoS from just 1 machine. SO YOU CAN STILL DDoS other servers, but try to set the DELAY TIME PER BOT to higher, maybe 5000, but that's not gonna do much damage to their server btw.

**Question: How can you be so handsome?**
Answer: Coding
